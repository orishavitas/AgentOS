# AgentOS docs (repo-only)

These docs describe **how to develop and operate AgentOS itself** (the scaffolder + templates).  
They are distinct from the docs that AgentOS generates inside scaffolded projects.

## Start here
- `docs/internal/PRD_AgentOS.md`: requirements SSOT for AgentOS
- `docs/agent-os/03_repo-architecture.md`: doc-layer split (AgentOS repo vs generated projects)
- `docs/agent-os/02_operating-model.md`: roles → skills → handoffs (repo-only)

## Execution docs
- `docs/agent-os/04_bootstrap-and-population.md`: scaffold + population flow (how templates become a repo)
- `docs/agent-os/05_validation.md`: validation expectations and how to run checks

## Future (documented, not implemented)
- `docs/agent-os/07_future-subagents.md`: router → roles → skills spec for future automation
