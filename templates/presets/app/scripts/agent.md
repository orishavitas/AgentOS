# Agent Guide — scripts/

## Mission
Own developer ergonomics scripts (setup, lint/test helpers, validation commands) for the project.

## Inputs
- `docs/QA-Plan.md` (what needs to be runnable)
- Repository tooling configuration files (as applicable)

## Outputs
- Scripts that make common tasks repeatable
- Updated run instructions (usually in `README.md`)

## Rules
- Prefer cross-platform scripts where possible.
- Keep scripts small and focused.

## Definition of Done
- A new developer can run the project using documented steps.

## Next Actions
1. Add a setup script (if needed) that installs dependencies.
2. Add a validation script that runs tests/lints.
