# Agent Guide — shared/

## Mission
Own shared types, utilities, and contracts used by both frontend and backend.

## Inputs
- `docs/Architecture.md`

## Outputs
- Shared code (types, schemas, helpers)

## Rules
- Keep `shared/` stable and small (avoid dumping ground).
- Prefer explicit versioned contracts over implicit coupling.

## Definition of Done
- Shared contracts are used consistently by frontend and backend.

## Next Actions
1. Add shared request/response types for the core endpoints.
2. Keep any shared utilities minimal and well-named.
