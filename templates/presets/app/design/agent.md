# Agent Guide — design/

## Mission
Define the core flow UX and the UI states (empty/loading/error) so engineering can implement without ambiguity.

## Inputs
- `docs/PRD.md`

## Outputs
- `design/User-Flows.md` (if used by the project)
- `design/Component-Inventory.md` (if used by the project)

## Rules
- Design the unhappy paths, not just the happy path.
- Keep artifacts lightweight (bullets + screenshots/wireframes as needed).

## Definition of Done
- Core flow is documented clearly enough for engineering to implement.

## Next Actions
1. Write the core flow steps (screen-by-screen).
2. List the required UI states and error copy.
