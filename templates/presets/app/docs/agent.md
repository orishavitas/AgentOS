# Agent Guide — docs/

## Mission
Maintain the project’s source of truth docs (PRD, roadmap, architecture, QA plan) and keep them aligned with the implementation.

## Inputs
- `docs/PRD.md`
- `docs/Roadmap.md`
- `docs/Architecture.md`
- `docs/QA-Plan.md`

## Outputs
- Updates to the docs above (keep headings stable)
- (Optional) Decision records in `adr/`

## Rules
- Prefer bullets and checklists over long prose.
- Keep docs consistent with reality (avoid drift).

## Definition of Done
- Docs reflect the current MVP scope and contracts.
- QA checklist exists for the core flow.

## Next Actions
1. Fill MVP statement + in/out scope in `docs/PRD.md`.
2. Define one core flow and capture it in `docs/PRD.md` and `docs/Architecture.md`.
3. Create a minimal checklist in `docs/QA-Plan.md`.
